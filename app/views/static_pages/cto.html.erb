			<p>We've known each other for seven years, and have been working on this since February 2013. Both of us had terrible procurement/sourcing experiences, which led to this idea.</p>

			<h3 class="center">What's SupplyBetter?</h3>

			<p>Matchmaking for buyers and factories - if you're looking to source a custom mechanical part, we want to be the best place to narrow down the thousands of potential suppliers to the few that are the best fit. We've started with 3D printing, and have paying customers.</p>

			<p>Our competitors are powerful, shady, and unpleasant to use (<%= link_to "Alibaba", "http://www.aliababa.com" %> and <%= link_to "MFG", "http://www.mfg.com" %> are the big guys). It's a tough, opaque industry to crack, though the market is huge.</p>

			<h3 class="center">Why we want a third cofounder / CTO</h3>

			<p>Matt can code well enough for now, but is more of a product/business guy. As we try to build the web crawlers, fraud detection, and matching system that we'll need to scale, we'd like to have a technical cofounder on board.</p>

			<p>We're bootstrapping until we have enough revenue to raise money at a good valuation, so we want to give out cofounder-level equity, and can't pay a competitive salary. We do have a frequently-used breadmaker, though.</p>

			<p>Current stack includes Rails, Heroku, Postgres, Twilio, SendGrid, and Segment.io. </p>

			<h3 class="center">Interested? </h3>

			<p>Email us! Either first name at supplybetter.com works nicely.</p> 
			<p>We'll have a conversation, and if there's potential fit we can work together for a few days and see how things go.</p>

			<h3 class="center">Sounds interesting, but I'm not CTO material</h3>

			<p>Get in touch if you're a good programmer and willing to learn - we'd be happy to consider interns that can work fairly autonomously.</p>
