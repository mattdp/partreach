What it is

 Additive manufacturing is the process of taking a 3D digital model and creating it in the physical world by fabricating it as a series of 2D slices. There are many ways to go about doing this and the technology has actually be around for decades. However, with some innovation, passion, and a few patents expiring(1), 3D printing been made accessible to the masses. 

As an example of just want the process is like, let’s say you want to make a lego brick. You can either:

Take a block of plastic at least as large as the total size of the lego brick. Machine away all the volume that you don’t want. Your result is a lego brick and all the scrap material you machine away. This is what is known as subtractive manufacturing. 

Take a spool of plastic filament and mount it on a Makerbot or other fused-deposition modeling machine. Import the design of the lego brick onto the machine. Now just watch as the ABS filament is fed through a heated extruder that places the material onto a surface one layer at a time until the brick has been completed. This is known as additive manufacturing.
