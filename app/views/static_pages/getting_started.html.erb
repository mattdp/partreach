	<h1>3D Printing: A Definition</h1>

	<div class="span11 offset1">
		<p>Additive manufacturing is the process of taking a 3D digital model and creating it in the physical world by fabricating it as a series of 2D slices. There are many ways to go about doing this and the technology has actually be around for decades. However, with some innovation, passion, and a few patents expiring, 3D printing has been made accessible to the masses.</p>
