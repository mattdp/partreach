      <h1>What is 3D printing?</h1>

      <p>3D printing is the process of building a 3D object by laying thin layers on top of one another to form the proper shape. Thanks to some innovation, passion, and a few patents expiring, 3D printing has recently become much more affordable.</p>
      <p>3D printing is a type of additive manufacturing, which contrasts with more traditional subtractive manufacturing.</p>
