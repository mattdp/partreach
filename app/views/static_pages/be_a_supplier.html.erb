      <h3 class="center">What's SupplyBetter?</h3>
      <p><strong>SupplyBetter helps connect serious buyers of custom parts with the best manufacturers for their needs</strong>. When making recommendations, we take into account the process, quantity, materials, timeline, geography, application, and supplier reputation. This makes sure we send buyers the right matches, and that suppliers only get RFQs that fit their business.

      <h3 class="center">What do we get by having a free profile?</h3>
      <p>A free profile on SupplyBetter provides potential buyers with information about your company and gives you the opportunity for free leads. <strong>If a buyer starts an RFQ by clicking "Request a Quote" off your profile, we will give you that lead for free.</strong> Join our paid network if you want us to actively seek leads for you - we send buyers to the suppliers that fit them best, paid or not, but when there are ties in our ranking we favor suppliers in our paid network.</p>

      <h3 class="center">How does SupplyBetter make money?</h3>
      <p><strong>There are no fixed fees or plans - if you're not bidding on jobs, SupplyBetter is free</strong>. All charges are on a per-bid basis: if we send you an RFQ and you want to bid on it, we pass your bid onto the client, and you owe SupplyBetter 1% of your bid, win or lose. You'll have a good chance of winning, since we limit the number of suppliers per quote, and you'll get the contact information of the buyer even if you don't win the business. Future business with that client doesn't have to go through us, or incur any fees.

      <h3 class="center">Why do suppliers pay per bid?</h3>
      <p>We like this system because it makes sure <strong>you only pay when you get valuable leads</strong> - if the lead isn't good enough to make a bid, you don't have to pay at all. Many of our competitors ask for a flat fee per month, and you have to pay that even if none of the leads were good.</p>
      <p>Charging based only on deals that complete would be ideal, but we haven't found a good way to enforce that without hiding the buyer's and supplier's identities from each other, and we want to be transparent.</p>

      <h3 class="center">I don't want to fill out lots of RFQs that don't lead to business.</h3>
      <p>That's a common complaint we hear about competitors. We make sure that doesn't happen in a few ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>5 or less suppliers bidding per job</strong> - since we ask for per-bid payment, we keep the number of suppliers per RFQ at 5 or less. If you're not winning bids, you won't want to submit more quotes, so we do our best to keep you winning.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation of buyer intent</strong> - we screen out people who don't have realistic budgets or expectations, or lack manufacturable models/drawings, so that you don't have to waste your time doing that.</li>
        <li><strong>Explicit disclosure of buyer priorities</strong> - buyers select whether cost, quality, or speed is most important to them, and you see that information before you bid. For example, if you compete on quality, not cost, we'll send you buyers that feel the same way.</li>
        <li><strong>We get smarter about what RFQs we send you</strong> - our system adapts to what RFQs you don't choose to bid on, and avoids sending similar requests in the future. You'll get RFQs that line up with your preferred quantities, applications, price range, etc.</li>
      </ul>

You'll need a proven track record and a clear idea of what sort of business you want.</p>
