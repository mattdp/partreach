<p>Hi<%= " #{@contact.first_name}" if @contact.first_name %>,</p>

<p>Just following up to let you know the bidding for this project is closed. The client has chosen a quote from a different supplier. I appreciate your looking into this project and look forward to sending you business again.</p>

<% if @email_type == "generic_with_check" %>
<p>In the future, is <%= "#{@contact.email}" %> the best email to use for RFQs?</p>
<% end %>
