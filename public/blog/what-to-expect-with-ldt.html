<p>This post is intended for people who are new to 3D printing and want to learn more about some of the most common 3D printing methods used today. Here we will discuss Laser Deposition Technology, or LDT for short. While there are great resources out there already with design tips, we want to help the curious buyer determine whether or not this is a 3D printing process that is right for them.</p>




<h3>What is LDT?</h3>


<p>LDT easily wins the "most names" award for additive manufacturing. At least 5 different companies have achieved similar processes and given them different names, including Laser Engineered Net Shaping by Optomec, Direct Model Deposition by POM Group, Laser Consolidation by Accufusion, and many others.</p>


<p>LDT is an additive manufacturing technique used to build functional metal parts. The process is similar to the DMLS process in that a powerful laser is used to fuse metal powder into a solid object. How they differ: where DMLS machines sinter cross sections out of a pre-rolled bed of powder, an LDT machine deposits the powder as it goes. As the laser heats the substrate (existing metal) to its melting point, fine nozzles spray metal powder into the molten pool, and the powder melts into the substrate. This means that the entire object is metallurgically bonded together, without the risk of weakness between layers.</p>




<h4>What LDT is great for:</h4>


<ul>  
  <li>Repairs. One of the most popular applications of LDT is in the repair of old or broken metal parts. For more on this, <a href=”http://www.twi-global.com/news-events/case-studies/innovative-additive-laser-repair-technology-used-in-restoration-of-iconic-ww2-spitfire-aircraft-557/” target=”_blank”>check out this case study</a> by the The Welding Institute.</li>
  <li>Mechanical Strength. Parts built with laser deposition have equal to-or better strengths than equivalent cast or wrought alternatives.</li>
  <li>Cladding. Laser deposition can be used to cover, or clad, an existing part in a metal shell. The maneuverability of many LDT systems allows them to clad complex parts.</li>
  <li>Fast build speeds. <a href=”http://www.3dprinterworld.com/article/giveth-and-taketh-away-cnc-milling-and-additive-laser-deposition-one-cycle” target=”_blank”>One source</a> claims that LDT can be up to 20 times faster than <a href=”www.supplybetter.com/blog/what-to-expect-with-dmls.html” target=”_blank”>Direct Metal Laser Sintering</a>, with deposition rates of up to 3.5 kg/hour.</li>
  <li>Many laser deposition machines have 5 axis capabilities. This allows them to print unsupported structures that would otherwise require costly support material. <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9IdZ2pI5dA” target= “blank”>See this video</a> for a great example of 5 axis laser deposition.</li>
</ul>




<h4>What LDT is not great for:</h4>


<p><ul>
  <li>Cost. Inherent complexities to this process make it one of the most expensive 3D printing processes. Unsurprisingly, the biggest demand for Laser deposition comes from the aerospace and defense sectors. Still, if LDT repairs mean that buying new parts can be avoided, laser deposition may be an extremely cost effective option.</li>
  <li>Ready-to-go parts. Just like with other metal additive manufacturing processes, the use of any support material means extensive machining after the build is complete.</li>
  <li>Tiny details. LDT is most commonly used to make large metal parts, and most laser deposition machines cannot create details as small as DMLS. <a href=”http://www.rpm-innovations.com/laser_deposition_technology” target=”_blank”>The width</a> of the deposition ranges from about 0.04 inches to 0.16 inches.</li></p>

<p><h3>What materials can I print with LDT?</h3>
<p>A variety of metal powders are compatible with laser deposition techniques. These includes alloys of nickel, cobalt, steel, and titanium.</p></p>

<p><p>Cheers,</p>
