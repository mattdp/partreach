TESTING

Do < 10.1.4 for all models
	models
		user 			X
		order			need to make the tests/factories
		dialogue
		supplier
		address
	for each
		is there any validation to steal from the user model?
			what presences are required?
			what max lengths?
		are all the _id fields not publicly exposed?
		are all the _id fields directly protected from user manipulation by a test?
		are they dependant on the right thing for destroys? 
		can you only see your own, unless you're an admin?

At end of chapter
	Get working for other models
	Set so can't even see other users, unless admin; right now, it's only modify

# X every order has a user
# X quantity is above 0
# X can't hit id via mass assignment
#can only see one's own orders (request)
#admin can see all orders (request)
