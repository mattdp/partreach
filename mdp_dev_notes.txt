potential v1 issues
	need the user address, so know where the part should go to
	supplier will return more than a price - days, questions, material information
	if no name, default of filename+date
	standardize if have suggestion text or not (could use for mandatory)
	no drawing shown on orders

order

[6] pry(#<OrdersController>)> params["drawing"]
=> #<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x007fd12bcfe870
 @content_type="text/plain",
 @headers=
  "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"drawing\"; filename=\"setup_todo.txt\"\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n",
 @original_filename="setup_todo.txt",
 @tempfile=
  #<File:/var/folders/ll/jvmtzdys3fv00c4p3hg0grmr0000gn/T/RackMultipart20130222-3099-ltv1p5>>

	next: update a file
		NOT WORKING, TOGGLED OFF
		remaining steps
			process the image in the controller
				not saving
					have checked that appropriate columns are in db
					seems to have a path with saving as drawing_name
			verify it saves, go get it
			update the show method to reflect it
			TESTS
			turn on validations, currently means can't save orders
			make files not visible to the public

TESTING

Do < 10.1.4 for all models
	models
		user 			X
		order			need to make the tests/factories
		dialogue
		supplier
		address
	for each
		is there any validation to steal from the user model?
			what presences are required?
			what max lengths?
		are all the _id fields not publicly exposed?
		are all the _id fields directly protected from user manipulation by a test?
		are they dependant on the right thing for destroys? 
		can you only see your own, unless you're an admin?

At end of chapter
	Get working for other models
	Set so can't even see other users, unless admin; right now, it's only modify

# X every order has a user
# X quantity is above 0
# X can't hit id via mass assignment
#can only see one's own orders (request)
#admin can see all orders (request)
