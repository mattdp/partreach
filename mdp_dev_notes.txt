is whenever making a crontab on my computer?
	judging by http://railscasts.com/episodes/164-cron-in-ruby, need to have a command manually to have it turn into a crontab
		to do command each deploy, railscast uses capistrano commands
is that running effectively?
how does it work on heroku?
does it autogenerate on a new deploy?
