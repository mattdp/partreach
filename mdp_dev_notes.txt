See if goes to order page - that'd be why no header with "my rfq"

BROKEN ON PROD - can't validate that signin happens when user already signed in, that's silly

For test suite issues, pick exactly one test, so can follow what it's doing well. Potentially print state information. Unclear why dialogue saving fails once issued, since order and user are fine.

Seems to pass in isolation now, maybe issue is lack of test DB clearance between run sets?
	Maybe something weird with using build instead of create, if they all got built initially then they'd try to save over the same names?
	I think factories only create different users when given a sequence, so the user will have to be totally new or somehow time-based

Need at least one test showing that the new user not only gets created, but makes it to the next page	

Look up how to get FactoryGirl creating a new user every time

TESTING

Do < 10.1.4 for all models
	models
		user 			X
		order			need to make the tests/factories
		dialogue
		supplier
		address
	for each
		is there any validation to steal from the user model?
			what presences are required?
			what max lengths?
		are all the _id fields not publicly exposed?
		are all the _id fields directly protected from user manipulation by a test?
		are they dependant on the right thing for destroys? 
		can you only see your own, unless you're an admin?

At end of chapter
	Get working for other models
	Set so can't even see other users, unless admin; right now, it's only modify
