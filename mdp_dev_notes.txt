[] step: have a rough approximation of the second page
[] step: styling
[] step: auth system sealing off from the world at large
[] step: importation of real data
  [] apply tags
  [] find flaws in data
    [] Xiangrun(3) - why #? why url not good?
  [] delete all data and reimport from cleaner data
  [] figure out how import on prod, since it's a filepath on local
[] step: have comments/visits/purchases - Detail

[] pull in james branch
[] verify rails_admin works for tags
[] train rob on making tags for each thing

whenever done, handoff to james in detail so he can pick up where left off

handoff
  [] anchor movement correct
    want to anchor the top of the page to the headers, currently have messed up links in there

eventual potential issues
  [] same supplier shows up many times with different tags
  [] Provider may be an overloaded name
  [] not taking suppliers with no URL on the uploader right now
  [] capitalization of mfg processes not good for CNC, BOM etc with titleize
  [] life is clumsy without tags, can't tell if it'd be more or less work to have them

later version thoughts
  [] step: have buttons on more/less/not useful
    <p>WIP Things that should be buttons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This profile made me more likely to check out this supplier</li>
      <li>This profile scared me away from this supplier</li>
      <li>This profile wasn't useful</li>
    </ul>
