adapt general sender to take communications

should have a method purely to find the targets, then use the general sender to dispatch them

#targets - list of lead_contacts w/o comm
general_event_sender(targets,,nil,false)

make into a communication sender


complexity since need to test Lead and add communications to it, but get email from leadcontact

think should have relevant classes implementing a contact method, taking to contact directly.
could instead have a method mapping models to getting their contact.
