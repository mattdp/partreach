NEEDS LINKING

Filling out a proper Request for Quote (RFQ) is the often the first contact a potential customer has with a supplier. To give our users the greatest chance at success, here’s our advice for how to get the most out of our RFQ service here at SupplyBetter. 

Files
STLs are the most common file type for 3D printing and have the widest acceptance, but we’re willing accept any file type as long as it’s relevant to your project. 

Quantity
Must be a number. If your requirement is more along the lines of “100 a month” or “50,000 pieces annually with quarterly POs”, then write those details in the “Final Notes” section.

Drawing Units
Satellites crash if the units are wrong, so best double check this. 

Material
We’ve dealt with everything from production-level parts to beginner sculptures, so feel free to reach out to us if you want help picking your material. Also, check our Materials page if you’re looking for other resources on how to decide. 

Postal Code and Country
The minimum necessary for us to produce a quote that factors in shipping. 

Particular Suppliers
If there is anyone in particular you’d like SupplyBetter to compare against, just enter their name here. 

Message to Suppliers
This is arguably the most important section of the RFQ. Suppliers love to get as much of an idea of just what it is you’re working on so they can understand your application and provide the best quote possible. 

Thanks,

Rob
