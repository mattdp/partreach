<p>This post is intended for people who are new to 3D printing and want to learn more about some of the most common 3D printing methods used today. Here we will discuss binder jet printing. While there are great resources out there already with design tips, we want to help the curious buyer determine whether or not this is a 3D printing process that is right for them.</p>

<h3>What can I print with binder jet?</h3>

<p>Binder jet printing is unique in that it can produce both and metal and nonmetal parts. For example, 3D printing service bureau Shapeways uses the binder jet process to produce steel and bronze parts, as well as its widely known Full Color Sandstone parts. Below are examples of parts made from both of these materials.</p>

<h3>How does binder jet printing work?</h3>

<p>The binder jet build process is similar to SLS <link>, where a model is built out of powder, one cross section at a time. Instead of using a laser to bind the powder, these printers use a glue, or "binder material." For each cross section, a moving nozzle prints the binder in the desired shape. Then, the build table is lowered, a new layer of powder is spread, and the next cross section is bound. This process produces a solid part in its "green" stage. The part is held together only by the binder, and is extremely fragile. It must now be processed to increase strength and durability, in a manner that depends on the type of powder used.</p> 

<p>Metal parts produced by a binder jet printer, such as Shapeways "stainless steel" parts, must be baked at very high temperatures. This actually fuses the metal powder together and melts away the binder material, forming a solid metal part. These parts tend to be porous, and require additional material to be infused to achieve adequate density. Once fully processed, however, they have mechanical properties comparable to those of cast metals.</p>

<p>Non-metal parts produced by a binder jet printer are usually coated in a lacquer to improve durability. They may also be infused with a resin to greatly improve mechanical strength.</p>

<h4>What binder jet is great for:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Relatively cheap metal parts. Compared to alternatives like DMLS and EBM, binder jet can be a cost effective way to produce larger metal parts.</li>
<li>Full color models and figurines. Binder jet machines are most commonly used to make full-color models.  Binder jet printers that are specialized for color print ink onto each layer to produce color parts, such as architectural models.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What binder jet is not so great for:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Complex geometry. Because of the weakness of a part in its green stage, extended overhangs and very thin sections may cause the part to break before or during post-processing.</li>
<li>Mechanical strength/durability in non-metal parts. Unless infused with resin, these parts are not meant for any structural roles. They also lose structural integrity when exposed to water.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, best of luck with your 3D printing!</p>
