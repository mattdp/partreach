<br><p>This post is intended for people who are new to 3D printing and want to learn more about one of the more common methods used today, Selective Laser Sintering (SLS). SupplyBetter has helped people buy SLS parts intended for both prototype and production use cases. While there are great resources out there already with design tips, we want to help the curious buyer determine whether or not this is a 3D printing process that is right for them.</p>

<h3>What is SLS?</h3>
<p>SLS is an additive manufacturing method that produces solid parts from a variety of powders, using a laser as its energy source. First, specialized software slices a CAD design into individual, planar, cross-sections. The SLS machine then rolls out a thin layer of powder onto the build table, and a laser traces the first cross-section of the object in the powder. This causes the affected powder particles to bond (sinter, to be exact) together into a solid slice of plastic. The build table is then moved down slightly, another layer of powder is rolled out on top, and the laser traces the design for the next cross-section. Each time a new layer is made, it is also fused to the layer below, forming a solid object. In this way, a part is built from the bottom up, with any overhangs supported by the un-sintered powder. After the part is completed, the excess powder must be removed by hand.</p>

<h3>Is SLS right for me?</h3>
<p>Let's start with an example. Take this part, for instance, and let's say I need 25 of them in my hands in a week. It has: 
<ul>
<li>Unique geometry (it is indeed a custom part).</li>
<li>Complex geometry. This makes it impractical to make this part using other manufacturing methods, like injection molding, without huge upfront cost.</li>
<li>Small outer dimensions.</li>
<li>A "living hinge." (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_hinge" target="_blank">What's a living hinge?</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an ideal use case for SLS 3D printing, and is actually from a real project that came through SupplyBetter. We helped the buyer find a service bureau that fit their project needs exactly. More on that in a bit.</p>

<h4>What SLS is great for:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Having the least amount of design considerations. You can print almost anything.</li>
<li>Producing a consistent matte surface finish. Parts generally look pretty great.</li>
<li>When you need relatively isotropic tolerances or mechanical behavior. (Isotropic means directionally independent.) Unlike <a href="https://www.supplybetter.com/blog/what-to-expect-with-fdm.thml" target="_blank">FDM</a> parts, which have much lower tensile strengths in the "z" direction, SLS parts have only slightly different mechanical properties for different build orientations.</li>
<li>Small parts.</li>
<li>Flexibility.</li>
</ul>
  
<h4>What SLS is not great for:</h4>
<ul> 
<li>Color. SLS parts are monochromatic, with severely limited color choices.</li>
<li>Same day speeds.</li>
</ul>
  
<p><i>But why not just go to <a href="https://www.supplybetter.com/blog/shapeways-vs-supplybetter.html" target="_blank">Shapeways</a>?</i><p>
<p>Shapeways is great for low cost, non-critical parts that don't have a short deadline. If a job is fit for Shapeways (or any of the other online service bureaus), then we'll definitely recommend them, but for jobs that require any degree of speed and quality, finding an SLS service bureau is the right choice.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
