title: Announcing the Launch of Supplier Profiles
published: true
meta_description: We've made finding manufacturing servies easier by publishing a public directory of 3D printing companies currently offering contract manufacturing services.

**We’re excited to announce that we’re launching [supplier profiles](http://www.supplybetter.com/suppliers) for 3D Printing.** We’ve been hard at work these past few months helping people get their custom mechanical parts made and this is just one more way we hope to make the experience better. 

**Here’s how this works:**

*  Browse through our [supplier profiles](http://www.supplybetter.com/suppliers) to see if there is a supplier that matches your spec
*  Click [“Get a Quote”](http://www.supplybetter.com/orders/new) to upload your part and submit a Request for Quote (RFQ)
*  Sit back and let the magic happen

Our passion is to be the best source for getting your parts made, and we do this by presenting the suppliers we believe are best able to fulfill your needs. Our [standard RFQ](http://www.supplybetter.com/orders/new) has already helped our customers achieve this, and we hope Supplier Profiles will make shopping for service bureaus even faster and more informative. 

Thanks,

Rob
