SupplyBetter loves 3D printing. 

FFF vs. FDM -  Nuances
	First, a clarification. Both of these 3D printing process are basically the same, and if you'd like to learn extensively about either, definitely check out thorough explanations of each here. This post is why you would choose one vs. the other. 

	Figure 1: A quick table
	Materials possible:
		FFF: ABS (a few different varieties), Nylon (6 and...), PLA, PVA (just don't), and maybe PC
		FDM: ABS (a few different varieties), Nylon, PC, bio-compatible, ESD, Ultem, and many many more. 

	Average price per cm^3
		Question: Do I have a good test piece to compare this with?
		FFF: $0.25 
		FDM: $???

	Tolerance:
		FFF
			XY:
			Z-height: 
		FDM
			XY:
			Z-height:

	Turn-around time:
	I don't actually know the answer to this question. What does it depend on? Does it matter? 

	Design constraints:
	FFF: Support material is your enemy
	FDM: May not be able to define infill

	Why should you choose FFF?
	If you plan to get final pieces printed in FDM want practically zero risk with quick turn-around time 



Themes to consider when deciding which process to use
Materials
Wall thickness
Trapped spaces
Undercuts
Future manufacturing plans
Finishing
Mechanical Performance
3D Printing vs. Other processes
	Machining
	Bending
	Cast Urethane
	Injection Molding
	Vacuum Forming
	Laser Cutting
