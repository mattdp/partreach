<p>Of all of the additive manufacturing processes, Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) and binder jet printing set themselves apart from the rest. The reason: these techniques can both be used to produce intricate full-color models. Advances in PolyJet technology have also allowed for full-color modeling, but with a limited color spectrum offered. For beautifully colored models, no other method competes with LOM and binder jet. Two major service bureaus offer binder jet technology: <a href="www.shapeways.com" target="_blank">Shapeways</a>, with their “Full Color Sandstone” material, and <a href="https://www.quickparts.com/home.aspx">Quickparts</a>, with their “ColorJet” technology.</p>

<h3>How they work</h3>

<p>Laminated Object Manufacturing works by stacking thin layers of build material. The material is most often paper, but can be plastic or even certain metal foils. The bulk of the material starts on a roll to one side of the build table, with one end stretched across the table and attached to an empty roller on the other side. A laser or blade cuts out the first cross section from the sheet on the table, and the table is lowered to separate the section from the undesired waste material. Then, both rollers are turned, causing the waste material to be rolled away to the empty roller and a new sheet to take its place on the build table. One side of the build material is usually coated with an adhesive that fastens each cross section to the next. Alternatively, the LOM printer may lay down adhesive selectively. When paper is the desired build material, the model can be colored layer by layer by an ink printer. This means that it has the same range of colors as any 2D printed artwork, and can be colored all the way through (useful for cutting cross sections in models).</p>

<br><p>We've already written about how binder jet printing works. <a href="www.supplybetter.com/blog/what-to-expect-with-binder-jet.html" target="_blank">Find that here</a>. For your viewing pleasure, here is another example of a binder jet part.</p>

<h4>How these processes are similar:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Both of these processes are capable of printing with a full cyan-magenta-yellow spectrum of colors.
-Both LOM and binder jet models are cheap to make. The paper used in LOM is inexpensive, and LOM models usually require no post-processing. Shapeways charges only $0.75 per cubic centimeter for its Full Color Sandstone, making it another cost-effective option.</li>
<li>Neither process produces structurally functional parts</li>
<li>Neither binder jet parts nor LOM parts should be exposed to water, as it will cause the colors to fade.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Where they differ:</h4>
<ul>
<li>LOM models have clearly visible "steps" caused by relatively high layer depths. The sides of these steps are the color of the paper used, usually white. binder jet models have much more uniform surfaces.</li>
<li>Binder jet models are brittle and easily breakable, while LOM models feel more robust.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Our advice</h3>
<p>For 3D models with minute details, binder jet is probably the way to go. Complex geometry, such as overhangs or thin walls, will be difficult with LOM, so complex models are better to build with binder jet. If the model needs to be handled, or has open, flat areas, then LOM may be the better choice.</p>

<p>As always, best of luck with your 3D printing!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
