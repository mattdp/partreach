<h1>Project Background</h1>

<strong>People love Gulpo. And so do we. </strong>

Gulpo is a novelty car emblem conceived by Zach Weinersmith and the Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal (SMBC) team. After Gulpo made its debut on their <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2094" target="_blank">daily webcomic</a> in late 2010, there was large demand from SMBC's fanbase to actually produce these car emblems for sale on SMBC's website. After finding someone who could produce a small batch, the product went on sale and was sold out in 2013. Gulpo was a success.

<h1>Focus</h1>

This is the story of how one relatively simple hardware product was made, and SupplyBetter's part in that process. Our goal in this two-part post is to provide a detailed account of the steps involved going from a design to physical part, so readers currently in the middle of (or about to embark on) a serious hardware project can learn from our experience. When you need custom parts, parts that can't be bought from a website or catalog, finding the right company to make them is often challenging. The effort necessary for success involves the intersection of two very different skillsets: engineering and business. If you're not good at both, you can quickly find yourself <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/18/technology/innovation/kickstarter-ship-delay/index.html" target="_blank">ill-equipped to address the tradeoffs</a> that need to be made in order to manufacture your product.

With this project we'll keep discussion of engineering requirements to a minimum, in order to focus on the business risks involved, and the attention to detail necessary to successfully outsource custom mechanical parts (here's a short list of the kinds of engineering details we're thankful we don't have to discuss: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_dimensioning_and_tolerancing" targer="_blank">GD&T</a> interpretation; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control" target="_blank">Statistical Process Control (SPC)</a>; Intellectual Property (IP) concerns; certifications (e.g. UL, CE, etc); and technical/engineering language barriers). Even though the particular details of this project may not directly apply to your product, the insights gained and lessons learned apply to anyone developing hardware. 

<h1>Gulpo Mark I and the Limitations of Laser Cutting</h1>

<strong>tl;dr:</strong> SMBC could not profitably scale up to meet demand, due to the financial and quality limitations imposed by the manufacturing process used to produce the original run of Gulpos.

<h3>Background on Gulpo Mark I</h3> 
Gulpo Mark I was laser cut from black plastic with a brushed metallic front face. The adhesive backing was also laser cut to match the profile of the design. Laser cutting was a great choice for the initial batch of Gulpos since the design is basically 2D and there is very little setup cost to actually cut it out. This is important because if SMBC was going to mass produce this product, they needed to first validate that there was actually a market willing to buy them at a price that made sense. Putting in the effort and money needed to produce a Gulpo that exactly matched the aesthetics of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthys" target="_blank">Icthys-themed</a> novelty car emblem wouldn't matter if no one wanted to buy it. Thus, choosing laser cutting as their manufacturing process meant they could validate their biggest assumption while minimizing their upfront costs to actually produce the design.  

<h3>Drawbacks of Laser Cutting for Production</h3> 
Laser cutting's initial blessing of having a negligible setup cost quickly becomes a curse once production quantities begin to approach larger volumes. Laser cutting is a fixed-time manufacturing process, which means that the time-per-Gulpo for QTY 1 is the same as QTY 500. In other words, the cost of making Gulpo is relatively fixed, regardless of the quantity being produced. Considering that SMBC only broke even with the last batch, they wouldn't expect their margins to improve just by ordering a larger amount. If SMBC really wanted Gulpo to make sense as a retail product, they were going to need to find a different way to produce them. 

<h3>Desired Improvement on Aesthetics</h3> 
The main goal of the initial batch of Gulpos was to validate that people actually wanted to purchase this product. Aesthetics were not a concern as long as they were good enough to validate this assumption - what is commonly referred to as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Now that their initial assumption was firmly validated, SMBC wanted the next Gulpo to look and feel like a normal car emblem. This required a smooth and glossy chrome-on-black surface finish as well as an adhesive backing that would not fall off a car bumper regularly exposed to the elements. While laser cutting was able to produce a chrome-on-black-ish surface finish, the results were neither smooth nor glossy. The surface finish wasn't smooth mainly due to the resolution of the laser cutter used, which etches the material by burning the surface line by line. While there are some great optimizations that can be done to improve the quality of images raster etched via laser cutting, you're not going to be able to produce a surface finish smooth enough to be glossy without a fair amount of post processing (i.e. sanding and polishing). Adding post processing as an additional step in manufacturing Gulpo would only increase the price per unit.

<h3>Manufacturing at Scale</h3> 
Despite the success of the first run of Gulpos, it didn't make sense to produce another run. Not including their time spent sourcing and managing the batch, SMBC just barely broke even selling Gulpo Mark I. It was too expensive to manufacture, and the product didn't look as good as they wanted it to. Their choice of laser cutting, while a great decision for prototyping the product, was not a suitable manufacturing process going forward.  

Simply put, if SMBC wanted a better product for cheaper they would need to take a fundamentally different approach.

<h1>The Path Forward for Gulpo Mark II</h1>

<strong>tl;dr:</strong> SupplyBetter needed to find a shop with the right capabilities (likely overseas) in order to meet SMBC's project needs.

To better understand the decisions made in manufacturing Gulpo Mark II, here are the "lessons learned" from the first batch, composed into a summary of requirements:

<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Same 2D design as Gulpo Mark I (e.g. profile, letter font, outer dimensions, etc)</li>
<li>Smooth and glossy surface finish</li>
<li>Silver chrome and glossy black colors</li>
<li>Materials (both main body and adhesive backing) must be durable and strong enough to withstand exposure to the elements while affixed to the back of a car</li>
</ul>
<h3>Buyer Business Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>SMBC wants the ability to produce in batches of 1500+ </li>
<li>Per-unit cost to SMBC needs to be low enough to make financial sense to sell at their current price</li>
<li>Per-unit cost cannot sacrifice quality/aesthetics</li>
</ul>
<h3>Supplier Capability Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Injection molding</li>
<li>Mold polishing (to achieve glossy surface finish)</li>
<li>Two color painting</li>
<li>Die cutting</li>
<li>Large batch production</li>
<li>Assembly</li>
</ul>
<h3>Supplier Business Specification</h3>
<ul>
<li>Already makes products similar to Gulpo (i.e. produces novelty car emblems)</li>
<li>Willing to send product samples</li>
<li>Can work with an Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) of ~1000 pieces</li>
<li>Willing to work off of milestone payments (vs. timelines)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rough Manufacturing Process Outline</h3>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_30vIImy7Q#t=27" target="_blank">Mill/EDM</a> the injection mold tooling</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jGpAzhzU8#t=30" targer="_blank">Polish the tooling</a> (to achieve a glossy surface finish on the parts)</li>
  <li>Paint chrome (all over the part)</li>
  <li>Paint matte black in recessed areas of design and on outer-facing edge</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY8ubb4AClY" targer="_blank">Die cut the adhesive backing</a></li>
  <li>Assemble adhesive backing and painted piece</li>
</ol>

Given the above specs, an injection molded body with a die-cut adhesive backing made the most sense as the manufacturing method of choice. Injection molding is fantastically suited for high-volume production of thermoplastics, which is why you see it being used in the majority of consumer products today. This meant that injection molding would be the most critical process to look for as a first filter when evaluating suppliers. Now that we knew the profile of suppliers we were looking for, it was time to actually go out there and find them. 

<h1>Identifying Suppliers on Alibaba</h1>

<strong>tl;dr:</strong> While it is certainly possible to find quality suppliers via Alibaba, you must exercise caution and understand the risks involved. 

<a href="http://styledemocracy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/alibaba-logo.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://styledemocracy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/alibaba-logo.jpg"></a>
<div class="footer" align="bottom" style="display:block;">Alibaba, a household name for anyone who has ever been faced with sourcing custom hardware overseas.</div>

SupplyBetter prides itself in finding that handful of suppliers who are the exact match for the job. The information necessary to judge a service bureau goes far beyond simply trying to understand which suppliers may be "good" and which suppliers may be "bad". We believe that parts will be better and cheaper if you start a vendor relationship with a company that already possesses the equipment necessary and understands the nuances of the manufacturing processes involved. Custom manufacturing vendors are more than just warehouses with spare capacity on their machines. It's the engineers and tradesmen behind them that can turn good designs into great products.

That said, we did not yet have a supplier network established overseas for the supplier profile discussed in the previous section. So where do you go right now when you need a consumer product made overseas? Alibaba. 

Alibaba can be ridiculously intimidating. A common perception held by many hardware designers is that reaching out to suppliers on Alibaba can be akin to directly emailing scammers to let them know you're their newest victim. While there are indeed quality suppliers to be found on Alibaba's marketplace, having an entire ocean and legal system between you and the people you're sending money to means there is very little recourse to be had for manufacturing deals gone awry. The suspicion that <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2011/02/online-fraud_scandal_china" target="_blank">you may be dealing with a fraudulent company is not unfounded</a>. This is why the in-person Asian factory tour is such a common practice with hardware companies sourcing overseas. For excellent first-person accounts of what the manufacturing ecosystem looks like, I highly recommend <a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2014/09/01/shenzhen-trip-r.html" target="_blank">Joi Ito's blog post about sourcing electronics</a>, <a href="http://blog.theopencompany.net/post/29079747110/going-to-china-to-make-the-perfect-tee" target="_blank">The Open Company's blog series on making a t-shirt</a>, and <a href="http://formdevices.com/blog/index.html" target="_blank">Form Devices blog</a> (with three excellent posts on manufacturing in Shenzhen, China).

Neither SMBC nor SupplyBetter was willing to jump on a plane and go on a factory tour since the price of the plane tickets alone would likely amount to more than the cost of the entire production run. For this project we were stuck with only online resources and our wits.

<h3>Pro-tip on Alibaba Supplier Discovery</h3>

Alibaba is best navigated by searching for similar products currently made by manufacturers (vs. just finding everyone who does "injection molding", or has a certain type of machine built for injection molding). We initially thought to search for "custom car decals", but that query was too vague and returned hundreds of shops making everything from bumper stickers to name plates. We decided to swing the pendulum the opposite way and get as specific as possible. Oddly enough, there were a handful of suppliers who were advertising as producers of Icthys-themed novelty car emblems. Vendors often post pictures of parts they make, and when we started to see examples of the Christian fish, the Darwin evolution emblem, and the Flying Spaghetti Monster we knew we were on the right track.

With our search term figured out, it was time to start checking boxes. Alibaba has a bevy of filters you can use to narrow your search result even further, and the general advice we'd gotten from those experienced with Alibaba or Aliexpress was to just check all of them (e.g. "Gold Supplier", "Verified", etc). Once done, we were down to 6 suppliers. This was as good as we were going to get. 

Now it was just a matter of figuring out the correct one to use for Gulpo Mark II.
