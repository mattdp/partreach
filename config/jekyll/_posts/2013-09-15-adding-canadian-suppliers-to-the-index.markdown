title: Adding Canadian suppliers to the index
published: false

As part of our effort to be the most comprehensive source for 3D printing supplier information, SupplyBetter is excited to add Canadian suppliers to our publicly facing supplier list. We've had several requests for more data on Canada, and so are debuting with XX suppliers. If you have one to add to the list, or want to let us know which country we should add next, drop us a line at feedback@supplybetter.com!

Until next time / Ã€ la prochaine,

Matt
