meta_description: Understanding the differences of using Shapeways vs. SupplyBetter for 3D printing is a great first step for sourcing your next 3D printing prototype.
---

<p>Customers, both new and experienced, often ask us for an overview of 3D printing technologies. Luckily, our specialty is helping people understand which 3D printing methods are useful right now for making parts. Here is a practical overview highlighting the different commercial 3D printing technologies currently accessible on the market. Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Most of these videos are promotional videos for the companies that make the 3D printers themselves. We did our best to cut out all the fluff and give you just the interesting bits. 

<h2>Plastic and Non-Metal 3D Printing</h2>
<h3><strong>FDM</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling" target="_blank">Fused Deposition Modeling</a>)</h3>
<div>
	<p>There is a great example of FDM's capabilities in the middle of this promotional video of the Fortus 900mc by Stratasys. Notice how the large build volume and liberal use of support material allows for huge end-use parts.</p> 
	<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/W5h2d7Vyj6s&hl=en_US&start=131&end=184"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/W5h2d7Vyj6s&hl=en_US&start=131&end=184" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
	<p><strong>Best use case:</strong> Large custom brackets that need good mechanical strength for either prototype or production applications. Also, parts that have large closed voids are well suited to this method.</p>
	<p><strong>Biggest disadvantage:</strong> Mechanical strength is highly dependent on build orientation. Specifically, the z-axis has a lower tensile strength than the x or y axis.</p>
	<p><strong>How common is this method?</strong> Very common. This is one of our most requested 3D printing options.</p>
	<p><strong>Alternatives to consider:</strong> If you're looking for cheaper parts that are not as strong then FFF may be a good choice. If you're looking for more flexible parts or a matte surface finish then SLS is a great alternative to consider.</p>
</div>

<h3><strong>FFF</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling" target="_blank">Fused Filament Fabrication</a>)</h3>
<div>
	<p>The best video example we found is this beautiful time-lapse of an Ultimaker FFF machine in action. When people say they have a 3D printer at home, this is most likely the technology they have. 
	<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/9pMjY7AmdBE&hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/9pMjY7AmdBE&hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
	<p><strong>Best use case:</strong> One-off, single use, non-structural, low cost parts. </p>
	<p><strong>Biggest disadvantage:</strong> Consistency between prints. In the work that we've done with service bureaus using hobbyist machines, consistency between prints is often cited as the biggest risk when considering any project that has a deadline.</p>
	<p><strong>How common is this method?:</strong> Very common amongst hobbyists.</p>
	<p><strong>Alternatives to consider:</strong> If you want stronger or more consistent prints, then FDM is a great choice. The differences between FFF and FDM can be confusing for a lot of people, so be sure to check out our post covering some of the <a href="https://www.supplybetter.com/blog/choosing-fff-vs-fdm.html" target="_blank">important differences between FDM and FFF</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3><strong>SLS</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering" target="_blank">Selective Laser Sintering</a>)</h3>
<div>
	<p>In 2010 Shapeways released a promotional video that succinctly demonstrates the different steps involved in SLS 3D printing their most common printing material, "Strong Flexible Nylon". What's important to notice here is that after the printing process is complete the parts need to be allowed to cool for a few hours before the excess powder can be removed. Chances are if you're aware of 3D printing you've heard of online service bureaus like Shapeways, and in a previous post we covered <a href="https://www.supplybetter.com/blog/shapeways-vs-supplybetter.html" target="_blank">the major differences between using Shapeways versus other shops</a> we can help you find using SupplyBetter.</p>
	<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/aBNGnfoGGfQ&hl=en_US&end=92"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/aBNGnfoGGfQ&hl=en_US&end=92" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
	<p><strong>Best use case:</strong> Thin-walled parts, parts that need some flexibility, and parts with large, open voids. These parts also tend to have a more consistent surface finish that FDM or FFF parts since it's more difficult to distinguish the individual layers in the print.</p>
	<p><strong>Biggest disadvantage:</strong> Any closed voids will trap the unused powder, resulting in more expensive parts (since you're paying for the enclosed material). If a service bureau re-uses powder between printing sessions on a large run of parts, then the consistency in mechanical strength can suffer (due to heat fatigue in the previously-used material).</p>
	<p><strong>How common is this method?</strong> Very common. This is a common printing method with both hobbyists and hardware companies.</p>
	<p><strong>Alternatives to consider:</strong> If parts have particularly large geometries with closed voids, then FDM is a solid alternative. If you need a smoother surface finish, then Polyjet or SLA should be considered. If you've already designed your parts but need incredibly tough parts, then DMLS is an (expensive) option.</p>
	<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Here's another promotional video highlighting the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/gLxve3ZOmvc&start=117&end=197" target="_blank">post processing techniques used for SLS</a> in producing engineering-grade parts by 3D Systems.</p>
</div>

<h3><strong>SLA</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography" target="_blank">Stereolithography</a>)</h3>
<div>
	<p>This promotional video from Materialise shows the complete SLA process, including post processing. In particular, notice the huge build volume and relatively smooth surface finish. These two features of SLA make it a favorite printing process for model makers since it's much easier to finish the parts. There's no sound, so check out this hilariously serious 3D Systems promotional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/iceiNb_1E0I&hl=en_US&start=19" target="_blank">video describing the SLA process</a> for a quick overview.</p> 
	<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/ky87zxNy1oo&hl=en_US&start=35&end=140"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/ky87zxNy1oo&hl=en_US&start=35&end=140" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
	<p><strong>Best use case:</strong> When parts have intricate details or need a very smooth surface finish. Also, this is one of the few 3D printing processes that can produce optically clear prints (with some post-process polishing). </p>
	<p><strong>Biggest disadvantage:</strong> Since these parts are UV cured, long-term exposure to sunlight can reduce mechanical strength.</p>
	<p><strong>How common is this method?</strong> Very common. This is one of the original commercial 3D printing technologies and has been around since 1986.</p>
	<p><strong>Alternatives to consider:</strong> Polyjet can produce prints very similar to SLA. Also, if you're looking for a plastic equivalent to these resin parts, then SLS is a great option.</p>
</div>

<h3><strong>Polyjet</strong> (Ink Jetting)</h3>
<div>
	<p>Here's another promotional video by Stratasys showing off their Objet Polyjet machine. What's interesting here is that they are printing these iPhone cases using different materials: VeroWhitePlus and VeroBlackPlus for the part plus support material. This allows the machine to print discreetly different parts at the same time while also allowing the machine to mix the materials together before they cure under UV light (which is where the gray-colored gears come from in the video)</p>
	<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/67cev_zcXJw&hl=en_US&start=117"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/67cev_zcXJw&hl=en_US&start=117&end=244" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
	<p><strong>Best use case:</strong> If you have a design that contains either different color or different durometer materials, then Polyjet is a great option. A great example of different colors is shown in the video above, and a great example of a part that would be best simulated with different durometers would be one that will eventually be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overmolding#Mold_design" target="_blank">overmolded</a>. Further, this process is similar to SLA in that it can produce very fine-resolution parts.</p>
	<p><strong>Biggest disadvantage:</strong> Similar to SLA, since these parts are UV cured, they will break down over time from exposure to sunlight. Also, the support material used in the printing process tends to mix slightly with whatever printing material it touches, which can cause the mechanical strength or surface finish to be inconsistent across the geometry of the part.</p>
	<p><strong>How common is this method?</strong> Very common. This tends to be a bit more expensive than the other 3D printing technologies shown so far in this post, but it's a favorite of hardware companies iterating on their prototypes.</p>
	<p><strong>Alternatives to consider:</strong> This technology produces prints very similar to SLA. Depending on the details of your project, one process might fit slightly better than the other.</p>
	<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Here's a video of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-AHm6dS44#t=61" target="_blank">huge 3D printed wrench</a> printed on a polyjet machine.</p>
</div>

<h3><strong>Sandstone</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_bed_and_inkjet_head_3D_printing" target="_blank">Binder Jetting</a>)</h3>
<div>
	<p>Shapeways shot this useful promotional video demoing the binder jetting process on sandstone. Notice how after the print is complete they need to use glue to make the print stronger. They take advantage of the fact that the prints are very porous when they come out of the printer, which means the glue can effectively seep throughout the part to make the piece stronger.</p>
	<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/hHxp9Ail6MY&hl=en_US&start=71&end=120"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/hHxp9Ail6MY&hl=en_US&start=71&end=120" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
	<p><strong>Best use case:</strong> Sculptures with a full range of colors.</p>
	<p><strong>Biggest disadvantage:</strong> Very brittle parts. This technology is not intended for use in any applications that require mechanical strength.</p>
	<p><strong>How common is this method?</strong> Very common. Along with SLS, this is a common offering from the large online service bureaus (e.g. Shapeways, Ponoko, Sculpteo, i.materialise, etc).</p>
	<p><strong>Alternatives to consider:</strong> If you like the surface finish, but need more mechanical strength, then SLS is a good option to consider (keep in mind that SLS produce single-color prints). If you're looking for a full-color alternative that isn't sandstone, then LOM is a great option to consider.</p>
</div>

<h3><strong>LOM</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminated_object_manufacturing" target="_blank">Laminated object manufacturing</a>)</h3>
<div>
	<p>Here's a useful promotional video from an MCor sales rep giving a great overview of 3D printing using paper. Notice how similar the results are to 3D printing in sandstone: both finished parts are full color and non-structural.</p>
	<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/s2h1k0cpgzQ&hl=en_US&start=41&end=109"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/s2h1k0cpgzQ&hl=en_US&start=41&end=109" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
	<p><strong>Best use case:</strong> Cheap sculptures with a full range of colors.</p>
	<p><strong>Biggest disadvantage:</strong> The prints are solid-feeling, but they don't have mechanical strength. Z-height resolution is also limited by the thickness of the paper, resulting in low-resolution prints.</p>
	<p><strong>How common is this method?</strong> Not common right now, but will be in the (hopefully) near future. Staples actually <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/04/10/staples-is-launching-an-in-store-3d-printing-service/" target="_blank">recently announced</a> that these machines are going to start showing up in their stores for on-demand printing. </p>
	<p><strong>Alternatives to consider:</strong> Sandstone printing is very similar since they can both produce full color prints. However, if you're looking for cheap single color prints, then FFF is a good alternative to consider.</p>
</div>

<h2>Metal 3D Printing</h2>
<h3>Binder Jet + Bronze Infusion</h3>
<div>
	<p>When you order a metal print from an online service bureau, they're typically advertising either the method in the video below or some type of lost wax/sand casting. Either way, there is significant post-processing happening when you order a metal print. The following is a "How It's Made" video showing how they create a very tough part starting with just metal dust and glue (very similar to the sandstone video above).</p>
	<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/i6Px6RSL9Ac&hl=en_US&start=40&end=285"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/i6Px6RSL9Ac&hl=en_US&start=40&end=285" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
	<p><strong>Best use case:</strong> This is the arguably the cheapest of the metal 3D printing technologies. Achievable geometries can be a bit limited (mainly because of the manual handing of the binder-jetted print before it gets infused with the bronze).</p>
	<p><strong>Biggest disadvantage:</strong> The lead time on these parts is a lot longer than any of the above methods. As you can see from the video, there are a lot of manual steps to this process.</p>
	<p><strong>How common is this method?</strong> Very common, mainly as a result of the large online service bureaus offering this method as their main metal 3D printing option.</p>
	<p><strong>Alternatives to consider:</strong> If it needs to be metal, then machining is a likely alternative. If the part needs to be metal and its details are intricate, then lost wax casting is worth exploring.</p>
</div>

<h3>DLP + Lost Wax Casting</h3>
<div>
	<p>The jewelry industry benefited enormously with the inclusion of 3D printing in their design process. What's interesting about this particular method is that it combines 3D printing with a manufacturing process that is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost-wax_casting#Archaeological_History" target="_blank">more than 5000 years old</a>. </p>
	<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/DDlhsu1yOe4&hl=en_US&start=411&end=690"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/DDlhsu1yOe4&hl=en_US&start=411&end=690" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
	<p><strong>Best use case:</strong> Jewelry and other applications that require metal parts with intricate details. Also, in cases where the final metal material is important this is a great way to get parts made entirely of gold, silver, or other precious metals.</p>
	<p><strong>Biggest disadvantage:</strong> Tends to be relatively expensive due to the large number of manual steps in the process.</p>
	<p><strong>How common is this method?</strong> Very common amongst artists and jewelers. It's a great way to cut down on the time between iterations on a jewelry prototype.</p>
	<p><strong>Alternatives to consider:</strong> If you don't have a specific alloy requirement, then binder jet + bronze infusion is a good option. If the parts are alloy dependent but of significantly larger geometry, then binder jet + sand casting is a great alternative.</p>
</div>


<h3>Binder Jet + Sand Casting</h3>
<div>
	<p>What's awesome about this video is it shows how the 3D printing method used in the Sandstone example (which makes structurally weak parts) can also be used to make engine blocks. This video demonstrates a manufacturing process known as sand casting, which can be used to make large solid metal objects. Ford uses 3D printing here presumably to prototype new designs for engine blocks before they move to tooling the mold for production.</p>
	<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/S6OZXdRoogY&hl=en_US&start=18"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/S6OZXdRoogY&hl=en_US&start=18" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
	<p><strong>Best use case:</strong> Large metal parts where the final alloy is very important.</p>
	<p><strong>Biggest disadvantage:</strong> Making these parts requires a large dedicated shop space since it's not that trivial to handle large volumes of molten metal. As a result, this process is very expensive (though a lot cheaper than the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXVLbzI3xTE" target="_blank">alternative mass-production method</a>).</p>
	<p><strong>How common is this method?</strong> Not common, unless you work for a major automotive, airline, or defense company.</p>
	<p><strong>Alternatives to consider:</strong> If the alloy isn't important, than binder jetting + bronze infusion will likely be a cheaper way to go. If the geometry is small, than DLP + lost wax casting may be a better choice.</p>
</div>

<h3><strong>DMLS</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_metal_laser_sintering" target="_blank">Direct Metal Laser Sintering</a>)</h3>
<div>
	<p>The best way to think of DMLS is that it's exactly like SLS (shown above) except it can do metal and is a lot more expensive. Other than that, they're pretty much the same.</p>
	<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/DW-2xaIDtMk&hl=en_US&start=9"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/DW-2xaIDtMk&hl=en_US&start=9" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
	<p><strong>Best use case:</strong> Parts that needs to be made of metal that require a quick turnaround time.</p>
	<p><strong>Biggest disadvantage:</strong> It is very expensive.</p>
	<p><strong>How common is this method?</strong> Not common, mainly due to the high cost of making the parts.</p>
	<p><strong>Alternatives to consider:</strong> If the part doesn't need to be metal, then SLS is a much cheaper option. If the parts do need to be metal but the alloy isn't important, then binder jetting + bronze infusion is a great way to go.</p>
</div>

<h3><strong>EBM</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron-beam_melting" target="_blank">Electron Beam Melting</a>)</h3>
<div>
	<p> Want to 3D print titanium parts? This is what you're likely going to use. It's very similar to DMLS, but needs more power and a more controlled build environment.</p> 
	<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/E7--ZWPVVdQ&hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/E7--ZWPVVdQ&hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
	<p><strong>Best use case:</strong> When you need to prototype a titanium part.</p>
	<p><strong>Biggest disadvantage:</strong> Incredibly expensive.</p>
	<p><strong>How common is this method?</strong> Uncommon, unless you regularly design titanium parts.</p>
	<p><strong>Alternatives to consider:</strong> If you're considering EBM, then you're likely designing a part that requires titanium. In this case, machining is likely the best alternative to consider. One warning: not a lot of machine shops will work with titanium since it is very difficult to machine.</p>
</div>

<h3><strong>EBDM</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_beam_direct_manufacturing" target="_blank">(Electron Beam Direct Manufacturing</a>)</h3>
<div>
	<p>Think of this 3D printing process like "CNC welding". This machine lays down line after line, and in the video you can see what basically looks like thick messy metal glue gun beads. After the print, the parts are then machined to their final geometry, which helps save on material cost (for when using exotic materials). Added bonus: because this is basically CNC welding, you can repair/alter existing parts by just welding directly onto the piece. </p>
<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/A10XEZvkgbY&hl=en_US&start=49&end=76"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/A10XEZvkgbY&hl=en_US&start=49&end=76" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
<p><strong>Best use case:</strong> Parts where casting, forging, machining, and other traditional metal manufacturing processes are just not cutting it.</p>
<p><strong>Biggest disadvantage:</strong> Incredibly expensive.</p>
<p><strong>How common is this method?</strong> Rare. I personally envy you if this is an option you're using in your design process.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives to consider:</strong> Machining is likely going to be the best option to consider if you're looking for alternatives. But then again, if you're actually considering EBDM, then why would you want to use anything else?</p>
