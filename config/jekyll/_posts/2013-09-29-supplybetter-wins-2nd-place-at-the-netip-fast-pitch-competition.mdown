We're proud to report that SupplyBetter recently placed 2nd at the [NetIP Fast Pitch Competition](http://www.netip.org/blog/2013/09/17/fast-pitch-competition-draws-in-a-huge-crowd/) here in San Francisco. We had the pleasure of competing against companies working on solving some really interesting problems such as [Airpost](http://www.airpost.io/) (1st place) and [CampBX](https://campbx.com/) (3rd Place). Thank you NetIP for letting us compete and [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/) for sponsoring the event. With our 2nd place standing we've won $1000/month credit on the Rackspace US Cloud portfolio for 12 months. We're excited to make the switch from Heroku to Rackspace, and we'll be sure to let you know how switching goes. 

Cheers,

Rob
